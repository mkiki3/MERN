Model View Controller

  Model - handles the application logic , interacts with the database. It includes all the info to represent data to the end user
  View - represents the UI, which interacts the user.It represents the modelâ€™s data to user
  Controller - its acts like the median between the view and model. It listens to the events triggered by view and queries model for the same

  What is middleware exactly?
  Is it a medium that handles request and responses????



Database
use store procedures instead of query calls
query and stored procedure do the same thing but the difference is that a query should be compiled everytime 
the query is executed,while the stored procedure is in compiled form when executed first time.I f we use
stored procedure  we can avoid recompilation of the query.
